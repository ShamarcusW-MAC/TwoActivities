# Week2-Day1-TwoActivities
An Android messaging app with a main Activity and a second Activity.
This application passes some data (a string) from the main Activity to the second using an Intent,
and displays that data in the second Activity.
It then sends a second different bit of data back to the main Activity, also using an Intent.
